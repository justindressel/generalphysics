How to Use These Notes
======================

The course is flipped, meaning that students are responsible for studying the core material outside of the synchronous class time. This format allows class to be more interactive with meaningful personal guidance and feedback from the instructor. It is crucial, however, to study the material carefully prior to entering the classroom so that the time better targets areas of difficulty and confusion, rather than remedial material more readily learned outside class.

The class roughly follows the [*Six Ideas That Shaped Physics*](https://physics.pomona.edu/sixideas) texts, in terms of content, recommended classroom practices, and homework practice. These supplementary notes provide an alternate perspective on the core material that complements that found in the main texts. The aim of these notes is to provide a clear presentation of how the core content fits together as a high-level overview, while building both the intuition and mathematics in tandem. In order to streamline the presentation of the key concepts in a reasonable amount of space, problems and examples have been used sparingly. 

These notes should be most useful after you have already familiarized yourself with the associated content as presented in the main text. The notes will then help reconstruct that learned content into a cohesive conceptual whole upon review. The notes should also serve as a useful study reference once the basic structure of the concepts is familiar.
