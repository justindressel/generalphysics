Notes on General Physics
========================

These notes supplement the General Physics introductory course sequence at Chapman University. The sequence is designed to roughly follow the texts of the [*Six Ideas That Shaped Physics*](http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas) series by Professor Thomas A. Moore at Pomona College, with integration of supplementary content throughout. Where appropriate, links to this main text sequence will be provided in the notes to provide further context, reading, and exercises. 

The course sequence and its chosen texts construct a *modern foundation* for introductory physics. This approach emphasizes core modeling concepts that seamlessly generalize to advanced topics and methods. Unlike sequences that relegate the "modern physics" of the past century to a special topics afterthought, this sequence integrates a modern perspective throughout the curriculum to prevent students from learning outdated concepts only to have to unlearn them later. 

The modern approach taken in the sequence leverages insights gained from active research in the foundations of physics by the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University. The foundational emphases have also been refocused to more directly highlight the deep connections between the well-developed methods of physical modeling and similar methods that have become fashionable in machine learning and data science. Similarly, examples have been tuned so that applicability of the concepts to physical chemistry, materials science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering are manifest.
