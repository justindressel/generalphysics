# Why Learn Physics?

Physics is historically the most developed modeling discipline, but its methods are now being applied everywhere, from traditional mechanical and electrical engineering applications, to computer engineering, to material science and nanotechnology, to modeling molecular vibrations and chemical reactions, to modeling protein folding and biomechanics, to modeling neural network clustering and propagation, to managing large volumes of data, and even to [training machine learning algorithms](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.91.045002). The better prepared students are to reason clearly about unfamiliar problems and use modeling tools trained by a rigorous study of physics, the more likely they will succeed in the job market.

Most scientific disciplines are becoming increasingly rigorous and precise in their methods. The easiest problems have already been solved, so the new generations must ratchet up the sophistication of the tools being used in order to creatively attack the remaining unsolved problems. Therefore, students who opt to receive only traditional training will likely find themselves underprepared for the challenges that will lie ahead in their targeted fields.  

Given this reality of the modern job market, learning the rigorous methods of physics is an opportunity for training and growth that will benefit a wide swath of possible future careers. Mastery of the modeling and problem-solving methods of physics dramatically helps distinguish scholars and employees and set them apart from the flood of cookie-cutter competition. Physics as a discipline is challenging precisely because it is so broadly useful and thus valuable as an employable skill.

Indeed, it often comes as a surprise to new students that the modeling tools of physics have broad applicability to a wide range of jobs after college, even if the jobs don't ostensibly seem related to "physics" at face value. Employers know that it is easy to train employees how to do many things on the job later, but it is much more difficult to find employees who can reason clearly about new situations and creatively solve unexpected problems. Nimble thinking and confidence with both reasoning and modeling is precisely what physics teaches students how to do.

Employers thus understand the intrinsic value of training in physics to build reasoning and problem solving skills. They often seek out employees who have such rigorous training precisely because they are demonstrably more effective in the workplace. Similarly, these rare skills warrant higher pay, so a physics degree can be incredibly valuable. The highest paid employees on Wall Street in the economics sector, for example, are invariably physicists. A physics degree opens as many doors as imagination dictates.
